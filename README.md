# Gantt-Chart-Generator
About:
🚀 The Gantt Chart Generator is a PHP script crafted to streamline the creation of dynamic Gantt charts. It empowers users to input task details, including names, start dates, end dates, and dependencies, through an intuitive PHP form. Leveraging this input, the script generates a visually appealing Gantt chart, illustrating each task's timeline with horizontal bars. Additionally, it supports the visualization of task dependencies, offering a comprehensive overview of project schedules.

Tech Stack:
💻 PHP: Powers server-side scripting for form handling and dynamic content generation.
🎨 HTML/CSS: Used to craft the user interface and style elements of the input form and Gantt chart.
🔧 JavaScript (optional): Enhances interactivity or facilitates dynamic rendering of the Gantt chart client-side.
🖼️ SVG: Offers scalability and flexibility for rendering the Gantt chart directly in the browser.

Required Software:
1. PHP Development Environment (e.g., XAMPP, WampServer): Required for local execution of the PHP script.
2. Text Editor or IDE: Essential for editing and viewing PHP script files.
3. Web Browser: Required to interact with the input form and view the generated Gantt chart.
